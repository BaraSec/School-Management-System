# School-Management-System


This is a mini School Management System I did for the "WEB APPLICATION AND TECHNOLOGY" course in a CS Bachelor program I am pursuing.

Used HTMl, CSS, JS/jQuery/AJAX, and PHP. The database is exported in the `Database Backup` folder. The credentials to login initially to the site are available in the `Initial Credentials.txt` file.
